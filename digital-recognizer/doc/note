a. check wether i get same result with k = 10 ( same, computer vision is promised)

1. try to select a good k
2. try to recover every image with matlab
3. try to binarize the images , and apply the knn algorithm.( failed )

4. try to neural network method
5. try to PCA reduce 
6. try to cross validation

7. try various features 
8. try deep learning

the best k is 3 with full data set

b. change the directory structe
    algo  -- store all file related to algorithms, all of C++
         this directory contains:
            1) some cc source code file for algorithm
            2) a Makefile to compile all cc files
         these algorithms will call opencv library, fann library or some other open source c library
         I will try to write my own version of algorithm.
            
    app   -- store all file related to applications, all of C 
         this directory contains:
            1) some cc source code file for some application. Try to do some work dealing with the data sets
            2) a Makefile to compile all cc files

    utils -- store all file related to utils, all of C

    mex   -- store all file related to mexs,  all of C

    inc   -- store all header file for C

    mat   -- store all matlab file, for test script 
            all test will fun in this Directory

    data  -- store all source data set
    res   -- store all result
